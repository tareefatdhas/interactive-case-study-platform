## üìã Pre-Deployment Actions

### For Vercel Deployment:

1. **Environment Variables Setup**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.firebasestorage.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.region.firebasedatabase.app/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Update App URL**: Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your Vercel domain

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Import project from GitHub/GitLab
   - Select the `case-study-platform` directory as the root

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Copy all Firebase config variables to Vercel's environment settings
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your Vercel URL

4. **Deploy**
   - Trigger deployment
   - Verify all pages load correctly

## üîÑ Session Management for 120 Students

### Architecture Ready for Scale:
- **Firestore**: Persistent data, queries, grading
- **Realtime Database**: Live session state, real-time updates
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles concurrent anonymous users
- **QR Code System**: Easy student access via mobile devices

### Recommended Session Flow:
1. Teacher creates session with QR code
2. Students scan QR code to join (anonymous auth)
3. Teacher releases sections progressively
4. Real-time tracking of student progress
5. Automated grading and participation tracking

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### During Live Session:
- Monitor Firebase console for connection limits
- Use teacher dashboard to track student engagement
- Release sections progressively to manage load
- Session auto-timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

### Post-Session:
- Export grades via dashboard
- Review student performance analytics
- Archive completed sessions

## üêõ Known Issues (Minor)
- Some TypeScript warnings in development (suppressed for production)
- QR scanner may need permissions on mobile devices
- Large case studies (100+ questions) may need pagination

## üìû Support
If you encounter issues during deployment:
1. Check Firebase console for connection errors
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Monitor Vercel function logs for errors
4. Use browser developer tools to debug client-side issues
